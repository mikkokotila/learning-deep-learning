# Learning Deep Learning 

Want to learn deep learning using vetted resources and a method that maximize the benefit you get out of your time? Look no further, you've come to right place. How do I know this method works? Most importantly, because I used the exact same method to learn myself, but I've taken out all the extra steps, repetitions and other headaches so you can in minimum time, get the maximum learning. Deep learning is super fun, so learning deep learning should be fun too :)
