# Learning Deep Learning 

Want to learn deep learning using vetted resources and a method that maximize the benefit you get out of your time? Look no further, you've come to right place. You'll be building your very own skynet in no time.

[Yes, I'm ready to go, beam me up](https://github.com/mikkokotila/learning-deep-learning/blob/master/ASSIGNEMENTS.md)

## Who is it for? 

For anyone who wants to learn deep learning fast. This includes those that have minimal programming knowledge / experience. If you can learn to play a more serious computer game, with the training I provide, you will learn how to deep learning. 

## Who is not for? 

If you're looking to learn a lot about maths, history of machine learning, etc. etc. etc. then you can basically just pick any book, course, or other resource out there, because that's what they all do. Also if you want to learn advanved programming tricks related to deep learning, we're definitely not doing that here. Actually, in 99% of the cases, all of that is absolutely useless anyways. 

## Why do you want to learn from me? 

- I have 12 years of continuous R&D in machine intelligence
- I was voted as the lecturer of the year in a [college I was teaching](http://www.pkky.fi/en/oppilaitokset/ammattiopisto/outokumpu)
- I'm a [highly rated speaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDhSGC6f7i0) in leading global events about data and technology
- Highly respected people give [raving endorsements on me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikkokotila/)
- I'm the Chair of the [I-COM Data Science Board](http://www.i-com.org/data-science-board/) 
- I'm the core developer of [Autonomio](http://autonom.io/), the first deep learning platform for non-programmers
- I have a completely [unique perspective](http://www.creative-sparq.com/science-technology?category=Science) regarding machine intelligence

## Why does my method work? 

I know this method words because it is based on how I learn myself. I dropped out of school when I was 11, and I never wrote a single mathematical function. Everything I know, I've learned myself, so learning is something I know a thing or two about. For this training, I've taken out all the extra steps, repetitions and other headaches so you can in minimum time, get the maximum learning. Deep learning is super fun, so learning deep learning should be fun too :)
