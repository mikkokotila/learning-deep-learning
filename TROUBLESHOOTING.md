# Troubleshooting 

Troubleshooting is one of the most common tasks a practical computer scientists (e.g. programmer or data scientist) will perform on daily basis. Without having the skills and confidence to handle various 'obstacles', working will be very frustrating. Usually it's better to ask someone only when you've depleted all other options. This is a very important point. 

### Standard protocol

1) Always start by making sure that you are not making some obvious mistake 

2) Next check from Google / Stackoverflow.com what kind of results you find for the problem 

3) If you still can't find anything after spending some time trying different things, ask someone you know 

It is very important to learn the process of troubleshooting this way, as otherwise it will be hard to work indepedently. Even experienced programmers face multiple obstacles on a given day, so it's very important to have an effective and self-sustained way to overcome any obstacle.
